Limits the time I can spend on youtube by disabling all pages and navigation (including watch next) except for the subscriptions page.

The effectively means I only watch new videos from a curated set of channels every day (assuming any channel has released a video). The trick here, of course, is curating an appropriately limited set of channels. To do so, I regularly prune and audit my subscriptions depending on whatever I'm most interested in at a given time.
