# [WIP] productivity

Some Tapermonkey scripts I use to improve my productivity.

## Writing Scripts

To enable modular code, each script follows a very specific file and folder convention which makes writing the bundling logic in rollup significantly easier.

Each script is composed of two parts:

- config.tm.txt = the config you would typically see at the top of a TM script.
- index.tm.txt = the actual script itself.

## How to Use

Check the `dist` folder for copyable scripts.
